Minigal Nano SSE
================

MiniGal Nano is a very simple image gallery. It only requires php and GD (no database, no special libraries like PEAR or ImageMagick). MiniGal Nano does not have a web admin interface: You only have to upload your images in the photo folder.

This fork (Minigal Nano SSE) is based on Thomas Rybak's version which seems to have been abandonned in 2010: http://www.minigal.dk/minigal-nano.html

This fork holds some improvements, like thumbnail cache and folder/image description.
